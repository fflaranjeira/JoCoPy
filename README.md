# JoCoPy
Script to perform Join Count Analysis in lattices.

JoCoPy is the main script. It calls other modules to perform different cases ('within rows', 'across rows', 'rook', 'queen') or graph  results ('graphJC').

Join Count is a standard analysis for incidence (presence, occupancy) data in both ecology and plant disease epidemiology. The script is based on the concepts found in Cliff and Ord (1981) book. It was validated using examples of Fortin and Dale (2007), Gumpertz (1997) and Madden et al (2007).
